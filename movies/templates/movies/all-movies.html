        once i get all the information from the request. It will replace the button with the table. Also
        when i click on the button, i made it so that the loader is in-line block so its visible now
        then when the table gets returned, it will actually remove the spinner by itself along with the button
        because it replaces the innerHTML like i said to do in the HTMX -->
